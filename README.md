PART-1
# Analysis of Gene Expression and Growth Data

This repository contains an RMarkdown workflow for the analysis of gene expression and growth data. The analysis explores nucleotide and amino acid composition, gene expression values, growth patterns, and statistical comparisons across datasets.

# Features

# Gene Expression Analysis

Downloading and processing expression data from TSV files.

Calculating mean expression across samples.

Identifying top genes with highest expression.

Filtering genes with low mean expression values.

Visualization of expression distributions using histograms.

# Growth Data Analysis

Downloading growth data from CSV files.

Calculating mean and standard deviation of tree circumference across sites.

Comparing growth over time (2005â€“2020) between northeast and southwest regions.

Visualization with boxplots.

Statistical testing using t-tests to determine significance of growth differences.

# DNA and Protein Sequence Analysis

Downloading complete coding DNA sequences for E. coli and Clostridium baratii.

Counting coding sequences and total coding DNA length.

Calculating sequence length distributions (mean, median, total).

Frequency analysis of nucleotides and amino acids with bar plots.

Codon usage bias analysis using RSCU values.

Identification of over- and under-represented protein sequence k-mers.
